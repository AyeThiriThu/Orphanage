      <h1>PRESERVING & STRENGTHENING FAMILIES</h1>
      <p align="container">One of the most tragic statistics you will read about orphaned children is not the estimated number of them in the world—143 million (although that number is mind-blowing). An even more tragic statistic is the number of children living in an orphanage that have at least one living parent. Some estimate that number to be over 80%. 

        80%! How can that be? Why is that so? Why do we have so many orphanages? Questions like these immediately come to mind. The reasons are complex and vary by country and culture. Abandonment, abuse, neglect, HIV, and gender preference certainly play a part, but, in my experience, poverty is the single biggest driver of children with parents being sent to live in orphanages. 

        Desperate moms and desperate families feel like the only chance for their children is to take them to orphanages in hopes of a better life. Women like Belnish in Ethiopia, whose husband died leaving her on her own to raise two young children, must make decisions no mother should ever have to make. Alone, afraid, and lacking the skills and opportunity to be able to support her children on her own, Belnish sent her youngest child, Benium, to live at an orphanage, knowing he would at least get food and an education.

        What if it did not have to be this way? What if we could come alongside highly vulnerable families, help them to stay together, stabilize, and move from merely surviving to thriving? That is exactly what happened with Belnish. She joined the Home Based Care program at one of our partner churches in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she was loved and cared for by the church as her life was stabilized. She was enrolled in a savings program, taught business skills, given a small loan to start a business, and then encouraged and supported as she brought Benium back home to her family.

        This is the core of the World Orphans mission – preserving and strengthening families.
        In Guatemala alone, we have prevented the need for four to five orphanages by caring for 250 children in our Home Based Care program. Families are staying together. Moms and dads are empowered to care for their children. Churches stand in the middle of it all, right where God would have them.

        David reminds us of God’s heart for families in Psalm 68 when he says, “God sets the lonely in families.”

      This issue of World Orphans Insight focuses on family. You will read stories about family in Iraq, Guatemala, Haiti, and Ethiopia. You will see the important role the church plays in families, and you will hear how World Orphans social workers are helping to strengthen families. We hope you will celebrate with us as we reflect on God’s design for family, his love for family, and our commitment to preserving families.</p>
