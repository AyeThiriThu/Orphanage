          <p class="lead">On 13 April 2016, We have decided to start a small charity and do everything we can in our spare time to raise funds for the good of unfortunate children living in orphan.
          We offer regular, consistent support to those in need so that the children in our care can develop over time, giving them the chance to create a brighter future.Our aim is to provide anything necessary for these children, from basic necessities to education support.</p>

          <p class="lead">Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the world, devastated with internal conflicts and civil war over the past 60 years. Despite being a gorgeous country with lovely people, Myanmar ironically has one of the highest rates of forced child labor, child soldiers and severe human rights violations. 30% of the children under five are suffering from various diseases. More than 50% live below poverty line. As many as 150 of them die every single day. We know that the only force capable of changing this everlasting grim fate of Myanmar is her youth. So our main focus is to support a healthy and well educated new generation.</p>
